1. 5.0 Test thoroughly if everything works and release (without expert settings)
    1. change "initial sorting" description based on real initial order by cutoff
    1. simple settings: use in tidybird folderlist (without changing per folder settings)
    1. add mark as read to simple settings (default for all buttons)
    1. resort after moving only after losing focus, so order does not change while using the buttons
    1. Check if we handled remarks in ATN reviews & github issues
    1. Moved folders not removed from MRM => remove folders in buttons that do not longer exist if we don't run over the folders but over the settings
    1. add debug messages including timing & export (see tbsync)
    1. TODOs & FIXMEs
    1. Create 5.0 release & test following procedure
    1. Store release procedure (once tested)
        1. Run last tests
            1. test basic functionality: moving
                1. test with a LOT of folders (#56) and maybe do some stuff we thought too costly, like getting account name and path from folder setting name to add to list
                1. test with UTF8 folders
            1. test layout
                1. test with different themes
                1. test with different layouts
                1. test layout options: button height

                1. test sorting
                1. test cutoff
        1. Check code quality
            1. Check code quality with eslint: `./node_modules/.bin/eslint .`
            1. Check code quality with web-ext lint: `./node_modules/.bin/web-ext lint`
        1. Generate release
            1. Run web-ext build: `./node_modules/.bin/web-ext build --overwrite-dest`
            1. Commit last changes if not yet done
            1. tag last commit as new version: `git tag -m "Tidybird <version>" v<version>`
            1. push to github: `git push`
            1. check if build succeeded, download generated .xpi
        1. Publish release
            1. Publish release as pre-release
            1. upload .xpi to add-ons site
            1. Once accepted, finalize release on github & set as latest
1. 5.1: Use new api: do when merged to master, so changes can be done only once. But those will simplify life!
    1. last used date -> not the same as last moved to date, it's the time folder is last opened
    1. get folders using query (even only folders that can hold messages?)
    1. deprecated: folder.type
    1. test other folder types (search, ...)
    1. deprecated: getSubFolders(folder) -> uses now folderId => no folder object needed anymore, check functions using it and supporting functions to get folder object
1. 5.2 Other optimisations
    1. once we have our own MRM: shorcut for our own undo (#74)
    1. once we have our own MRM: check for reset, show info in iterface (#40)
